# Open Access Research

_Open access is not simply about putting data online._ (A deep discussion about the failings of the techno-utopianism of 'the digital' is [Colleen Morgan](https://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/)'s [phd thesis](https://www.academia.edu/2997156/Emancipatory_Digital_Archaeology)). Open access means making our data available in *useful* formats; it means *exposing our thought process*. It implies transparency in our peer reviews; it demands accountability in our governance. Accordingly, in terms of my teaching, I make not just my readings etc 'open' but also the process of our learning. I require you to make your materials open as well (with caveats; see below). I am open about how I grade - and the criteria we use we develop together. But baby steps, baby steps...

## First step: our notes
As historians, we aren't all that accustomed to sharing our research notes. We go to the archives, we take our photographs, we spend *hours* pouring over documents, photographs, diaries, newspapers... why should someone else benefit from *our* work?

There are a number of reasons why you should want to do this. Read and be prepared to discuss the arguments advanced by these folks:

+ [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/)
+ [Caleb McDaniel](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
+ [Ian Milligan](http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/)
+ [another post by Milligan](http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/01/27/why-canadas-open-data-initiative-matters-to-historians/)
+ [Jo Guldi and David Armitage, ch 4](http://historymanifesto.cambridge.org/read/chapter-4-big-questions-big-data/)
+ [Mike Caulfield](http://hapgood.us/2014/11/06/federated-education-new-directions-in-digital-collaboration/)

But most importantly, *change is coming whether historians like it or not*. Here in Canada, SSHRC has a [research data archiving policy](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/about-au_sujet/policies-politiques/statements-enonces/edata-donnees_electroniques-eng.aspx)

> All research data collected with the use of SSHRC funds must be preserved and made available for use by others within a reasonable period of time. SSHRC considers “a reasonable period” to be within two years of the completion of the research project for which the data was collected.

Note the [conversation that ensued on Twitter after Milligan mentioned all this](https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932470001897472) and also [here](https://twitter.com/ianmilligan1/status/524932589875101697)

## Things to think about: 
+ how can we make our research notes open? 
+ what does that implies for how we do research?
+ how we can use this process to maintain our scholarly voice online?

Really, it's also a kind of ['knowledge mobilization'](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/community-communite/index-eng.aspx#2). In the workbook I created for my online undergraduate course on [crafting digital history](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/Open-Access-Research/Exercises/) there are exercises on how to use services like [Dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io), [Prose.io](http://prose.io), and [Stackedit.io](http://stackedit.io) to make changes to a [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file. Feel free to browse or take a copy of that workbook.

## Split content from container

First, read Charlie Stross on [Why Microsoft Word Must Die](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html).

Now, take a look at [sustainable authorship in plain text using pandoc and markdown](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown). We will be giving this a spin ourselves. Indeed, it is one of my goals for my course that you integrate these approaches into your research process going forwards.

# Caveats about putting your stuff online

The online world is not always (or even primarily) a safe space. Open access is not without its dangers, for you personally and academically. We need to talk about these things. 

For all public-facing work, you may use a psuedonymn for everything that leaves a trace on the internet, if you so desire. Just let me know who you are! There is value in using your real name, and I strongly suggest you look into reclaiming your digital identity; but what is safe for me as a middle-aged white man to do online is not safe for everyone. You have the right to not have any public facing work at all; should you invoke this right we will arrive at an equitable solution that meets the learning objectives of this course.
