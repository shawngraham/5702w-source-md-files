Traditionally, one would sort these to go into the various weeks of the seminar. If you look at the [schedule](weekly.html) you'll see that there is a broad progression through the various stages of doing digital history work - from setting up your research environment, through getting & cleaning your data, to analyzing and presenting it. I think you can work out which of the readings below speak to these different stages. In your individual presentations I encourage you to bring in literature from your studies and personal research as seems appropriate. But if you find yourself stuff, then pick from this list.

Again in no discernable citation style, I give you,
